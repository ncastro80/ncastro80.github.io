### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    I enjoyed Lab 6 part 1 (Mad Libs) because it taught me how to use the Unix command line
    in conjunction with the index. I learned how to access elements within a vector using the 
    ‘.at()’ function by providing the index. In addition, I created string variables based on 
    the element index values. This lab also helped me implement input validation by verifying 
    the number of command line arguments. I ensured that I provided only three arguments after the command name. 

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7 part 1, I enjoyed learning how to use logical operators, nested if-statements, 
    and Boolean operators/expressions. My partner and I wrote functions to implement parking 
    restriction rules based on signs. For each function, we implemented if-statements and 
    carefully considered the day and time limits for each street by using logical operators 
    and number ranges. This was a great practice, as it simulated how the code can be used for systems, 
    like an app that explains when and where you are allowed to park.

* Lab 8 

    In Lab 8 part 2, I utilized my understanding of loops to generate a pattern. 
    I used three for-loops, which consisted of one outer loop and two inner loops. 
    I learned how to create a counter-controlled for-loop for each loop. 
    It took me several attempts to achieve the desired pattern output, 
    but I liked how the challenge was rewarding in the end.
